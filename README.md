# Archery Inspiron

Dotfiles for my Dell Inspiron running Arch Linux. 

A couple of notes:

* I use XMonad, but don't do much tiling of actual windows. I use one window per workspace and let the window tile/tab itself.

* I use tmux to allow tiling behavior in the terminal, and emacs does this automatically.

* No window decorations or even a status bar. I keep a terminal on my laptop's builtin monitor for querying system info (via htop most of the time). I keep battery on my tmux status bar so I don't forget about it.
